<section class="about-me">
    <div class="container-About">
        <div class="description">
                <p>I've spent more than nine years working in the design industry, starting my career in 2014 as a Junior Graphic Designer. During those initial three years, I focused on mastering design principles, typography, and creating visually appealing graphics.
                    In 2017, I transitioned into the role of an Art Director, a position that marked a significant shift in my career. Here, I wasn't just creating visuals; I was leading creative projects and collaborating with production teams. <br>
                    My responsibilities included brainstorming, content creation, and even dabbling in video editing. I thrived in this role, discovering my passion for guiding creative teams and fostering an environment of innovation.<br>
                    After three years as an Art Director, I ventured into the exciting worlds of cryptocurrency exchanges and Web3 gaming NFTs. In my four years as a Senior Visual Designer in these industries, I combined my design expertise with a deep understanding of blockchain technology.<br>
                    I created user-friendly interfaces for crypto exchanges and crafted visually stunning NFT artworks.<br>
                    My role in these fast-paced industries required adaptability and the ability to collaborate with diverse teams of professionals, from developers to marketing experts. I contributed to ground breaking projects that redefined finance and entertainment.
                    In summary, my career has been a journey of growth, from Junior Graphic Designer to Art Director and, finally, to a Senior Visual Designer in cutting-edge industries. I'm now eager to take on new challenges and continue pushing the boundaries of visual communication.
